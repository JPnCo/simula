 * This package contains the default implementation of the SIMULA interfaces.
 * <li>EventImpl that implements simula.Event
 * <li>SimpleActor: a simple actor acts as a delegate and implements the
 * standard behavior of an actor.
 * <li>It processes STOP-VENT and START_EVENT.
 * <li>It signals STOPPED_ACTOR_EVENT to its associated engine.
